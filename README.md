# Risk Analysis Notebook

This project focuses on **risk analysis** using a combination of machine learning techniques and deep learning models. The primary goal is to predict potential risks based on patterns in the data by building and evaluating various models.

### Key Features:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial investigation of the dataset to identify patterns, correlations, and outliers. Visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** are employed to understand the underlying structure of the data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values, feature scaling, and transforming categorical variables. This step ensures that the data is clean and properly formatted for model input.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Several traditional machine learning algorithms from **Scikit-learn** are used, such as:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forests
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  
- **Deep Learning with PyTorch**: In addition to traditional models, the project explores the use of deep learning techniques with **PyTorch** to build and train neural networks for risk prediction, particularly useful for capturing complex patterns in the data.
  
- **Model Evaluation**: Various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves are used to evaluate the models. Cross-validation is also applied to ensure generalizability and robustness.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python**: Main programming language for data manipulation and model implementation.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
- **PyTorch**: Used to build and train neural networks, exploring more advanced predictive capabilities.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating data visualizations and presenting model performance.

This project showcases the full workflow from initial data exploration through preprocessing, model building, and evaluation, demonstrating how traditional machine learning and deep learning techniques can be applied to risk analysis.
